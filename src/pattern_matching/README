Solution is provided in python2.7, there is also a unit test file provided which captures both the basic sample inputs
required by the problem statement to solve, and more robust inputs that I've created. Test inputs are also provided in plain text (input_file*) along with
their results (output_file*) when running from bash e.g. cat input_file_robust | python2.7 pattern_match.py > output_file_robust

Running time for the find_best_match_pattern method is O(n^2logn), over-all is O(n^3logn)
